  <h2 class="HeadStyle1">&#x1F467 About Me</h2>
  <p class="ParagraphStyle1">I am currently a master student at Imperial College London, studying toward a degree in computing. I was a typical student by day, superhero by night (well, not really, but a hero in my own world). I was successfully earning my undergraduate degree in mathematics last summer. &#x1F393</p>
  <p class="ParagraphStyle1">But life is not just about lectures and exams for me. I am also passionate traveler, constantly seeking new adventures and collecting passport stamps. There's nothing like immersing myself in diverse cultures, tasting exotic cuisine, and wandering the streets of different cities. My heart truly belongs to the great outdoors, whether it's hiking through lush forests, camping beneath the stars, or chasing waterfalls. Nature is my ultimate playground! &#x1F30D&#x1F308</p>
  
  <h2 class="HeadStyle1">&#x1F4BB About This Website</h2>
